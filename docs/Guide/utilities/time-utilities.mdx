title: Using Time Utilities
---

## Introduction

Sometime working with `Time` and `Duration` can be hard to handle. `@sapphire/time-utilities` is a small package that
contains a few utility classes that eases working with `Time` and `Duration`

## Installation

```bash npm2yarn2pnpm
npm install @sapphire/time-utilities
```

## Usage

Since this package contains multiple utility classes, we will see one by one how they work.

### Duration

`Duration` class can be used to convert a human readable time string to milliseconds.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import { Duration } from '@sapphire/time-utilities';

const duration = new Duration('1d');

console.log(duration);
// { offset: 86400000 }

console.log(duration.fromNow);
// Logs the date from now
```

### DurationFormatter

`DurationFormatter` class can be used to convert milliseconds duration to a human readable string.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import { DurationFormatter } from '@sapphire/time-utilities';

const ms = new DurationFormatter().format(3600000);

console.log(ms);
// 1 hour
```

### Timestamp

`Timestamp` class contains multiple methods that can be used to deal with timestamps easily. Let's see a quick example
of how to use it.

`Example`

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import { Timestamp } from '@sapphire/time-utilities';

const timestamp = new Timestamp('HH:mm:ss');

console.log(timestamp.display(3600000));
// 06:30:00

// edit the initialized pattern to include date, month and year in timestamp
timestamp.edit('DD-MM-YYYY HH:mm:ss');

console.log(timestamp.display(3600000));
// 01-01-1970 06:30:00

// convert a date to UTC date
console.log(Timestamp.utc('2022-04-25'));
// 2022-04-24T18:30:00.000Z
```
